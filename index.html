        <h3>Great Pyramid of Giza</h3>
        <p>
          The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid and
          served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled under the Fourth
          Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Built in the early 26th century BC, over a
          period of about 27 years,[3] the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven
          Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained
          largely intact.

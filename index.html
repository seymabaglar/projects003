        <h3>Great Pyramid of Giza</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid and served
          as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled under the Fourth Dynasty of
          the Old Kingdom. Built in the early 26th century BC, over a period of
          about 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the
          Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained largely intact.

        <h3>Colossus of Rhodes</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek sun-god Helios,
          erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name,
          by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
          World, it was constructed to celebrate the successful defence of
          Rhodes city against an attack by Demetrius Poliorcetes, who had
          besieged it for a year with a large army and navy.

        <h3>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the
          Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a
          remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered
          gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines,
          resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was
          said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near
          present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.

          The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of
          Alexandria, was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Ancient
          Egypt, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. It has been

        <p>
          The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or Tomb of Mausolus (Ancient Greek:
          Μαυσωλεῖον τῆς Ἁλικαρνασσοῦ; Turkish: Halikarnas Mozolesi) was a tomb
          built between 353 and 350 BC in Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey)
          for Mausolus, an Anatolian from Caria and a satrap in the Achaemenid
          Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was
          designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene.

        <h3>Temple of Artemis</h3>
        <p>
          The Temple of Artemis or Artemision (Turkish: Artemis Tapınağı), also
          known as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an
          ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis (identified with Diana, a
          Roman goddess). It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of
          Selçuk in present-day Turkey). By 401 AD it had been ruined or
          destroyed. Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at
          the site.
